# Event Emitter 🔊

Version 0.1.0

## Cross-env TypeScript Event Emitter

The `EventEmitter` class provides a mechanism to handle events and their listeners.
It allows you to register event listeners, emit events, and manage the listeners for those events.

This class is an exact implementation of the `EventEmitter` class from 'node:events'
but it is supported on different environments like browsers, Edge Runtime and Node.js.
